            here:

            Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the
            server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.

            deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on
            different devices and requirements.

            of notifications to your website visitors.

            Back-end Data Loading - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are
            doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.
