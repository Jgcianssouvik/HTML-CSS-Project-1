            Help students understand how the web works with these web design and development tools. Are your students
            interested
            in learning HTML, CSS, PHP, and the nuts-and-bolts of how websites get designed, built, and maintained?
            Maybe they
            just want to brush up on the basics of coding so that they can better understand their increasingly
            web-filled
            world. Or, perhaps they're just looking to launch a personal site or publish content with a WYSIWYG tool
            like
            Squarespace or Wordpress. On this list, we've assembled a nice mix of tools for each scenario.

        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. My Vission : </h3>
        <p class="p-1 text-justify">
            There is one thing every web developer should aspire to: writing the most minimal, semantically appropriate,
            valid
            HTML, and then never changing it. “Never” not in a sense of denial and refusal, for structural changes can
            always
            require modifications, but in the sense of a guiding light. The idea of minimal, semantically appropriate,
            valid
            markup tickles the most out of us as web developers. It leads us not only to supreme markup quality but
            pushes us to
            acquire and exhibit bigger powers in our style sheets and scripts.

            The cover of “The Little Book of HTML/CSS Frameworks.”

            The vision is one of highest efficiency, to handle presentational changes only through CSS updates and
            behavioral
            ones only through JavaScript updates. Writing HTML, design-agnostic as it should be, has always been
            underestimated;
            it’s the hardest to write well.
