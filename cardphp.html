            The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic
            content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications.
            This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP.

           <strong> Why to Learn PHP? </strong>
            PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it
            was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

            PHP is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they
            are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning PHP:

            PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

            PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content,
            databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.

            It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix,
            and Microsoft SQL Server.

            PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The
            MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.

            <strong> Applications of PHP : </strong>
            As mentioned before, PHP is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them
            here:

            PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write, and close them.

            PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, through email you can send data,
            return data to the user.

            You add, delete, modify elements within your database through PHP.

            Access cookies variables and set cookies.

            Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.

            It can encrypt data.

           <b> Audience</b>
            This PHP tutorial is designed for PHP programmers who are completely unaware of PHP concepts but they have
            basic understanding on computer programming.

            <b>Prerequisites</b>
            Before proceeding with this tutorial you should have at least basic understanding of computer programming,
